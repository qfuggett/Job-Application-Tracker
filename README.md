## Job Application App
A Ruby on Rails, React-Redux application that logs daily tasks and jobs applied to.

## Installation
`cd job-tracker` to enter the backend to `bundle install`, then `rake db:create db:migrate` to set up the database needed. 
In a new terminal, `cd jobs-client` to enter the front-end and run `npm install`.

## Usage
In the terminal for job-tracker, run `rails s` to start the backend server. 
In the second terminal and run `npm start`, a new browser will automatically open with the page loaded.
